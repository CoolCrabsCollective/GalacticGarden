Instructions:

  - Plant seeds on asteroids
  - Harvest them once grown to gain energy
  - Defend crops & space station from cosmic crows (damage drains energy)
  - Buy Boost & Weapon upgrades from space station
  - Survive until the final wave, face Lord Crow himself
  - Running out of energy means GAME OVER

Game Mechanics:

  - Seeds are planted in plant holes by approaching asteroids and pressing LMB
  - They are harvested by flying near them once grown
  - Harvesting a seed gives Energy
  - Energy functions as health, if you run out of it the game ends
  - Energy is reduced when the fighter jet or space station takes damage
  - Energy can also be used to buy Booster and Weapon upgrades by approaching the space station and pressing F
  - Some weapons (The Nukes, Quad shot, and Flamethrower) also consume some energy per shot
  - The enemies spawn in waves at fixed intervals

Lore:

In the distant future, a race of intelligent crows has ravaged Earth, consuming all plant life leading to environmental collapse. Humanity flees to space where they grow special radioactive plants to use as an energy source but also eat for food. But soon the crows and their nefarious leader Lord Crow develop spacecrafts of their own and fly in space in search of the humans. You play as Celestial Chad: a space cowboy and farmer who farms these strange space plants along with Cadet Candice and their space station.
